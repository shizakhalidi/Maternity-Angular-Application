# Maternity-Angular-Application
An application for a maternity site, where users will be able to register. 
Then they will be able to login and upon logging in they will be able to access a personal dashboard where they will have the following options: 
1. Note taking interface: They can create personal notes, where they can add a title, short description, due date and time. They can also add a label color to classify their notes and check the note if the task has been completed. They also have the option to edit and delete notes. 

2. Appointment manager: The users can select the type of doctor with whom they have their appointment, select date and time. They can also delete and update their appointments.

3. Mood tracker: Since mood swings are a crucial part of pregnancy, thus with the application, users can select how they feel right now, add in a brief description and this will create an entry for the current date and time for their mood. The users can also view their profile description and logout once they are done. 

All data is retained as the application is connected to Mongo db. 
Here is the link for the project video where we briefly explain the code and show the working of the application. https://youtu.be/29u0rjeMj0Y
